                    After a successful redesign of the main page, navigation, training grounds, and land pages the project founder approached me to help design

                <h2 className="project2--body">
                    The main hurdle to overcome from the founder was he had commissioned art for the "Crafting" area that he didn't want to get lost, players were confused 
                    about if they could use the page and which characters could, and he wanted to create a sense of excitement and achievement.

                <h2 className="project2--body">
                    Next to <b>remind players which characters would be able to craft items</b> I added two buttons to the side panel that would toggle between the available Shoguns. I 
                    also designed the character select panel so that <b>players could select multiple Shoguns and craft multiple items at one time to help players</b> who needed to craft
                    many items at once.

                    Simply speaking many aspects of the Shogun War game can be boiled down to the player selecting a Shogun to use, rolling a dice or using some king

                    It was also important to add a "Skip" button so that returning players wouldn't have to wait through the welcome and intro screens.

                    from the "Crafting" page.

                    The darkness and bouncing progress text helps build a bit of suspense so the results text lifting up from the bottom and lightening the image should help

                    Finally, we get to the results. There were 3 outcomes, poor, good, and amazing. Since I brought the players hope and excitement up leading to the

                <h2 className="project2--body">
                    If the result is good, I added some rays of light coming out of the forest with a larger rewards icon to show the success of the player.

                    After launching the Beast Forest, the player feedback was great, the new pop up for players who didn't have a Shogun that could access the forest 
                    really helped limit confusion, and with some of the rewards introducing a new item "The Wolf" it created huge incentives to play and replay.

                <h2 className="project2--body">
                    One bit of negative feedback I heard from users was that for players with lots of Shoguns looking to play over and over as much as they could, the elements added
                    to build suspense, the darkening of the image, the bouncing text, and the slight delay before the rewards took to long. For players replaying the forest a lot
                    they wanted a way to get to the results quicker.

                <h2 className="project2--body">
                    So after talking with users and keeping that feedback in mind, I began designing the "Tomb of the Undead King!"

                    The final level design I oversaw was the "Tomb of the Undead King" which was going to be the first boss level. Again, though like the ‚ÄúCrafting‚Äù 
                    page and the ‚ÄúBeast Forest‚Äù this is a simple version to keep players engaged and help fund the development of the much more advanced game.

                <h2 className="project2--body">
                    This level is very similar to the Beast Forest but where I was testing new design ideas for equipping items and skipping through some of the 
                    slower parts. These ideas were being tested based on user feedback and interviews conducted.

                <h2 className="project2--body">
                    So again I was given a main image to use as the background, I used the same Welcome message style as the Beast Forest, used the image to create the color pallet, 
                    the same grid and modal layout, and added different light elements to the image for the different results.

                    After completing the new designs for the ‚ÄúTomb of the Undead King‚Äù we tested it with a few users who loved it, some did want a way to bulk select 
                    so they could select all the warriors at once and have them play all in one go. The project founder didn't want to explore that too much since we 
                    wanted players to spend more time in the game and with the exception of a few power users‚Äô players didn't have enough Shoguns that would make running 
                    through multiple times take too long.

                    This was the final level I designed for the project which was never implemented. The users were excited to see more development in the 3D game 
                    and with the small size of the team and the worsening market conditions focus was shifted in that direction.

                    After leading the redesign and the new level designs the project was able to fix a lot of the major issues users were running into. The 
                    navigation was fixed, all main areas were redesigned with the same layout for consistency, search and filter options were added, bulk actions 
                    could be performed making it much easier for players to get the maximum results. And three new areas were designed increasing player retention, 
                    improving new player onboarding, and increasing revenue for the project.
