                        The main purpose of the Battle Warriors project was to create a gaming ecosystem with lots of different games where holders get special perks, access, 
                        and rewards.

                        The first game is called the "Survival Grounds", a side scrolling platformer where players can control "Ragnar" our main character as they try to avoid 
                        axes, arrows, spikes, pits, and more.

                        The big challenge to creating a game like this is how to balance access, many other games made it so you have to own a certain NFT to access the game 
                        and after playing there were large cool downs. This is fine for players with lots of characters but for new players or others with just 1 or 2 it creates 
                        a situation where most players will be able to play for very short periods of time and then have nothing to do.
